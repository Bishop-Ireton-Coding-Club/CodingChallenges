# CodingChallenges
> Some coding challenges to pass the time during the Coronacation.

## How to participate
`git clone` this repository to your computer. If you don't know what that means, check out the [HackBI online GitHub Workshop](https://github.com/hackbi/GitHubWorkshop).

Once you've done that, **don't make changes to any files in the repo**. If you do, you won't easily be able to update the repo as new challenges arise.

Make your own repository and make your solutions there. Put it on your GitHub and send Will and Critter the link once you're done so they can verify you got it done.

## Updating the Repo
Simply `git pull` to update the repo. If you have problems, you probably changed a file you weren't supposed to change. That's fine, just do a `git reset --hard origin master` before `git pull` to fix it - note that **this will revert any changes you made**.

## The Challenges
Each challenge is stored in a folder titled something that looks like `01-ChallengeName`. Navigate to it at the top of this screen (that is, https://github.com/Bishop-Ireton-Coding-Club/CodingChallenges). In that folder, you'll see all of the necessary files to complete the challenge as well as a `README.md` explaining what the challenge is and what the rules are.
